# Why choose to port an existing malloc/free lib?

---

 Creating a 32 bit os is a hard task itself ,along with it creating  memory allocator makes it much harder.
 Also if a memory allocator is created we will have to check for errors and debug if any are found .
 A much simpler way would be porting an existing malloc library to the kernel space in the os .
 We can focus on creating the os rather than spending a dedicated amount of time creating a memory allocator and as it is a well tested library we wouldnâ€™t have to debug it. 
 Hence porting is fast, scalable, stable and requires less time to implement. 
 There are different types of memory allocator and the developer can choose the it according to the need of the os. 
 We will be using liballoc which was once part of Spoon Operating System.

# Describe the hooks that need to be implemented

---

 Hooks allow memory managers to request memory in terms of pages from the kernel.
 The page size is obtained from somewhere in the source. 
 Number of pages required is the parameter accepted by hook. 
 Basically  4 types of hooks are implemented 2 of which are used for page allocation and deallocation and 2 used for locking and unlocking critical session.

1. void *alloc_page(size_t pages); 
   Takes page size as input parameters , allocates consecutive pages  in virtual memory and returns a pointer pointing to the beginning of the group .

2. void free_page(void *start, size_t pages);
   no of pages to be free and the starting location in memory as input parameters and frees allocated pages in virtual memory.

3. void wait_and_lock_mutex() ; 
   locks the mutex before memory manager executes a memory process of a singe thread entering the critical session .
   We can apply mutex lock simply by disabling all the interrupts or by using spin lock.
   
4. void unlock_mutex();
   Mutex is unlocked after memory manager leaves the critical system .
   Unlocking can be done by re-enabling the interrupts or resetting the spin lock.

# How are the hooks actually implemented using the existing physical page allocator?

---

 The page size is obtained from the liballoc_init() function .

 1. For allocation of page we are using : void* liballoc_alloc(size_t n_pages) .
  The number of pages required for allocation is accepted as a input parameter and if the required number of ages is not available while considering all the number of unallocated pages then the function returns a NULL value. 
  If the required number of pages are available then memory allocation stats from pointer *start  .
  Consecutive pages is allocated till the number of required pages is satisfied .The pointer of the allocated memory is returned.

2.  For deallocation of pages we will be using : int liballoc_free(void* start, size_t n_pages) . 
  The values returned from void* liballoc_alloc(size_t n_pages)  is passed as input parameters into this hook. 
  Here we set a starting point to start deallocation of memory .Consecutive pages are being deallocated and added to the free page. 
  The number of pages to be deallocated should be given in the formal parameter .
  0 is returned if the deallocation of pages are successful.

 3. For locking of memory data structure we are using : int liballoc_lock() .
  We have decided to clear interrupts instead of implementing spinlock.
  Interrupts are cleared using asm("cli"); and if the lock acquired is successful ,0 is returned .

 4. For unlocking of memory data structure we are using : int liballoc_unlock() . 
  Setting back the interrupts are done using asm("sti") command.
  Return 0 if the lock is releaed successfully.
